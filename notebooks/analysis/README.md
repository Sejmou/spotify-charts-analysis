# Dataset Analysis Notebooks
In this folder, I collect several notebooks analyzing my collected data from different angles. While I am still working on stuff, this might be a bit of a mess.

As of 31st July 2023, all the analyzed data was obtained with corresponding Python scripts in the `cli_scripts` folder of this repository. This includes the following:

- Charts data from 1st January 2017 up until 30th June 2023 (`get_charts.py` followed by `combine_charts.py`)
- Track, Artist, and Album metadata collected from the Spotify API stored in corresponding subfolders (obtained with `spotify_api/get_all.py`)
- Track credits and (incomplete) lyrics metadata for tracks that were retrieved from an internal Spotify API through some 'hacks' (`use_internal_spotify_apis.py`)
